# ArcherKnightWebTest
 Technical Test 

How to Setup:

Not entirely sure yet but 

in the db index.js change username and password to your own details.

Make sure the password is using my_sql_native_password and not caching_sha2_password or the application won't work see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50373427/node-js-cant-authenticate-to-mysql-8-0


Database Choice: 

For the database I went with MySQL as it is the same database used within ArcherKnight. It makes sense to use this as if I get the job I'll  already have some familiarisation with the database.
